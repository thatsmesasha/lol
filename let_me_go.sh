Can't hold it back anymore.
Let it go, let it go,
Turn away and slam the door..
I don't care.
what they're going to say..
Let the storm rage on.
The cold never bothered me anyway
Let it go, let it go,
I am one with the wind and sky,
Let it go, let it go,
You'll never see me cry..
Here I stand..
And here I'll stay..

Let the storm rage on..




Let it go, let it go,
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go,
That perfect girl is gone..
Here I stand..
In the light of day..
